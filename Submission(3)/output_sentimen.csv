A Google user,Currently the event weapon designs that you can get you can't use. In a reward it gave me 50 I could claim for one of 3 hunters so I chose Melin and I have them in my inventory but when I go to use them from there it takes me to crafting(not the right place because it just opens it generally) and I have searched everywhere in there and in weapons and the only option I have is to use the crystals and 4 of the red designs. The item is currently not usable. Please fix.,2,2025-04-17 17:31:42

A Google user,"The worst gaming experience. My account was banned from rank trophies for no reason. The same is happening with a lot of other players who play it on Android. The customer support says that nothing can be done. I spent so much time gaining the trophies, and now they banned all the trophies and I will not get them back once the ban is lifted. Also this is due to a glitch from the system which they don't want to resolve. The support team is just so useless. I am quitting this game forever.",1,2025-04-17 17:18:59
A Google user,this game has a lot of bugs when i was playing chapter one when the story ended my screen turned black for a whole minute it won't go back to the game so i need to rejoin multiple times to finish a single chapter not only that but at chapter two in the beginning it won't even let me finish a single quest i was pretty confused considering i already did everything it keeps putting me back to the lobby meanwhile when i was checking the gacha my screen froze and it won't let me move not even a bit,2,2025-04-17 17:02:03

A Google user,Players deserve assurance that their system is safe. They have an AI that lashes out and randomly bans players. This Faction of the Shield is rubbish and the game is not optimized for mobile players. Although it is fun to play when you get banned because of a program pre installed on your phone and they say it is an illegal program and you get banned its not fun anymore.,1,2025-04-17 11:43:34

A Google user,I really enjoyed Solo Leveling: Arise at first — the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is fun. But I was unfairly banned from ranking rewards even though I played normally and never cheated or used any suspicious tools. What’s worse is that the game itself is full of bugs and constant freezing. Sometimes I can’t even finish a stage without the app crashing. It’s frustrating to be punished while the game’s own stability is a mess. Please fix all your defects and detection system.,1,2025-04-15 22:44:27

A Google user,I really like this game but the game becomes damn near impossible to advance once you hit level 80. it requires tons of gold and essence stone to get anywhere once you hit that level but the game doesn't give you enough to steadily advance. also there seems to be a bug with the new tier 100 gear where even if you advance it to the max some of the gear values don't chance making it worse than the tier 78 gear.,3,2025-04-12 23:42:33

I could not even start the game due to constant blackouts; in the title screen, intro cutscenes, and when I restarted the app and clicked skip. It still did not work properly. Call me impatient but that's the way it is. what I desire in a game is a consistent play through, and I will accept frame drops but not complete blackouts. i will play this game again, maybe in the future, once it's okay.

A Google user,"the game is very good to be honest.. but at some point it's just very difficult to progress without money.. what you grind for weeks as f2p is never enough.. one example is new characters, I used to play every single day and use all new codes I barely get the character to 1 star sometimes I can't get it, while with money you can easily get the character and even max it, it's just pure pain for f2p. the game is really good but too much time and money are needed.",3,2025-04-09 11:07:37

A Google user,"Got past the tutorial and as it is rather fun, it's too easy in my opinion, fights end in less than a minute if your actually trying, the tutorial itself is very restrictive as well and I find that annoying, and it's asking for far too much space, for that reason alone I decided to uninstall, if y'all make it take up less space maybe I'll give a proper review...",1,2025-04-07 09:05:15

A Google user,Why dont you guys animate the anime hoho,5,2025-04-07 05:11:47
A Google user,this game is a poor clone of zenless zone zero and others like it but unfortunately this one doesn't do it very well. the story is convoluted and laughable and seems like it's just thrown together to try and come up with something new and different but they fell short and it's just meh. if the combat was a bit better it might be acceptable but there's an auto mode that defaults on most of the time because they know the combat sucks and you won't like it and certainly won't have fun with it,2,2025-04-07 04:53:25

A Google user,8GB of additional downloads after launching the game. Expect to wait 10 minutes to play. Need to focus more on gameplay and bugs. Far less on cinematic scenes.

Even with Low Graphics, the game constantly crashes, logs me out, and I can't play properly. It’s really annoying because the game should run smoother, especially for lower-end phones.

A Google user,its great,5,2025-03-25 14:36:11
A Google user,had potential. absolutely ruined it all. Your main power source is this game is gacha(20%) and artifacts (80%). Artifacts make up most of ur dmg. The artifacts system sucks. You spend weeks grinding them to finally get 1 good one and it just messes up while levelling it up. The sub stat upgrades always go to the bad sub stat. If we get to choose what sub stat gets the +1 I would defo give this game a 5 star rating,1,2025-03-25 14:23:29

Here is why: 1. the download was taking ages 2. once you are playing the game starts to twitch, not sure if it's about bug issues (not an expert) 3. when you think things are going smoothly while playing story mode, it gets stuck in between. 4. I can't remember how many times I had to restart the app, probably close to 40 times. I'm currently on level 4 in the game, only managed episode 2 of the ""story mode"".

Which means I might need compensation for that problem in the next update. I hope you consider this since I am a solo leveling fan-player.

The gameplay is fun... when it decides to actually work. But more often than not, you're stuck staring at a frozen screen, wondering if the game is waiting for you to level up your patience. It's like the game is trying to level up itself by testing how much frustration you can handle. 1/5, would not recommend unless you enjoy staring at a black screen.""",1,2025-03-10 01:55:00

A Google user,This game could be so much better if it was open world and somewhat similar to how genshin impact is played the way it is I feel like it's missing something or doesn't match the anime and what I would expect the game to be like . But just my opinion it could be better especially if you had more free will with the characters as well as items .,2,2025-03-05 11:14:22

O jogo é totalmente (90%) gacha, é um jogo feito de qualquer jeito, jogabilidade repetitiva, mapas repetitivos, missões repetitivas, o jogo se repete sempre do mesmo jeito com pequenas alterações visuais e de mecânica pra deixar um pouco mias diferente.

Even though the name of the game and anime is solo leveling. Co-op will definitely be more interesting and more would definitely join,4,2025-03-03 18:45:58

So the techs do watch out and protect F2P and P2W player experience.

I have had no issues with black screen or problems with the overall functionality of the game.

Great story amazing adaptations it has alot of extra side stories from the manwha and 100s of hours of captivating gameplay; It has plenty of ways to easily get draws and gems also plenty of ways to get leveling and awakening materials there is a certain pay to win aspect but nowhere near as much as other games and pay-to-win aspects can't be avoided because the game still needs to make money The UI could be better organized though.. but 5 stars,5,2025-02-13 10:57:56

A Google user,I would give the game a 5 star rating since it is exactly how I would have expected from a game based on this anime. In fact I would say the only way it could be better is if it had an offline mode. That said I hate it when games pressure you to spend real world currency especially when (without the intention of going in the offline route) the game will be dead after so many years.

A Google user,It's a great game the gacha element doesn't feel too mandatory to progress the game. It's honestly really great game would one hundred percent recommend you give it a try it allows you to build jinwoo in a way that you think Jin woo should've done his build and you can arise people that Jin woo didn't in the book nor the anime. But speaking of shadows I do say it really does bum down progress when you want to build Jin woo around his shadows so I just wish we could unlock them faster I would say,4,2025-02-12 02:17:13

A Google user,"The game is excellent in terms of graphics, missions, characters, and story - truly deserving of 5 stars. However, I'm giving it 2 stars because the loading screen appears frequently, which can be frustrating. Edit: I've also noticed significant lag, even on my 8GB RAM phone, and the battery drains about 1% every 2-3 minutes. I really enjoy the game, but I hope these issues can be addressed.

A Google user,I wanted to just update my review. I find myself loving the game for what it could still have in future updates. And it's pretty darn nice to play some of the challenges. But also I find the new raid fight on Normal mode to be pretty rough considering that I have the bare minimum of the recommended power and I'm just wondering just how much is someone going to need to play and finish Hard mode? I hope it gets checked for balance because it seems too much for the current average player. IMO :D,5,2025-01-27 15:56:06

With plenty of side missions and various modes, there's always something to do to improve your character. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are stunning, and the overall experience is top-notch. All this game needs is a bit more time for optimization, and it will only get better from here. Definitely a must-play for fans and newcomers alike!✨",5,2025-01-21 10:16:12

A Google user,"Amazing game, great adaptation to the manwha and anime, I just hate that there's a level requirementent in story mode. The recommended power level is an awesome feature, and I think it's enough on its own. There's no need for a level requirement, it's unnecessary. Also, some people are powerful enough to blast through despite not being that level. I assume it's for ptw people to not go by without grinding, but it's unecessary. But everything else is amazing, I love how f2p it is.",4,2025-01-19 02:04:34

A Google user,I've been playing this game from the beta test. There were a lots of loading screen at that time after battles. Now most of them are fixed. There are more contents and limited events that give you a lot of rewards including SSR characters and weapons. I would say this is the most f2p friendly gacha game. Even casual players can get those rewards. I really like the story with Manhwa slides. The combat is not boring and it's great with extreme dodge and quick swap style :),5,2025-01-18 16:30:03

And I would love to say that it's bring infinite amount of rewards & quality of life in the game now than before the release. And I think only problem is that when you are in character lobby you can't clearly see the costume details and face detail as the screen looks way to bright which take away the details I think please change the background of the character lobby or just improve its detail ( lag issue 😕 pls fix)",5,2025-01-16 15:39:52

A Google user,Game is very nice. Follows the manwha and its amazing for free to play players as well. The character drop rates and weapon rates are pretty good. One thing I would recommend the developers is that the hunters could be salvaged those which we dont use often similar to the weapons. Hopefully they do that soon. Otherwise the games a solid 9/10.,5,2025-01-16 14:36:28

The camera couldn use a bit more work, I'd prefer it if it would pan into the remaining enemies instead of me manually turning around which is kinda annoying.

A Google user,It's fun but can use some changes. The biggest problem is the time limit it puts on every level. With a time limit of roughly 3 minutes it is brutal when you have to fight three rooms of enemies and then the boss. Most of the big bosses you will have to fight at least 10 times because of this. I hope you change this so people can enjoy the boss fights and get to learn off of them too instead of rushing through it blindly and not being able to have any fun fighting the boss's.,4,2025-01-14 10:05:59

And if I go cancel. closes the game. So I can't even play it. I was hoping the other comments were just device related. Hopefully the devs can get this game playable.,3,2025-01-13 00:55:50

Seriously I need some compensation for the waste of time this game has caused to me as I am a big fan of Solo Leveling manhwa and anime and this game just dissapoints me. I have literally played many levels on this game but after completing the level just before the end rewards menu the game bugs out and restarts causing me to lose all my progress. Please fix this loading mess.,1,2025-01-12 03:36:40

A Google user,"Game is very good as the story is excellent. But the developers didn't do a good job running the game. Game sometimes gets struck in loading screen, while playing it gets fast forward sometimes, why? we don't know. In addition to that, the game thinks that fast fast forward as some sought of hack we are using and gets you banned from playing certain content. The developers won't give any explanation for that. They are only after money 🤑.",1,2025-01-02 02:08:42
A Google user,Wow the game is really an ok game so far not too greedy for money they offered pretty good rewards too and it turned out better than I expected hope they don't change. Also whenever the game is loading it takes too long and I know my connection is ok it's really laggy and slow I've tried all I can to stop it but the lag is still there pls fix.Secondly after I play for some time the game stops then I have no option than to restart i have sufficient storage space fix I don't like it.Game is laggy,3,2025-01-02 01:19:20

A Google user,The game is really cool considering it's made of solo leveling but the biggest problem is that it's a story mod and not an open world it doesn't give us the choice to actually play with dungeons and grind as solo leveling should actually be if it became an open world with different avilable classes and abilities it would be sick,2,2025-01-01 21:14:53

A Google user,"Pretty good game, decent leveling system, due to the gold/XP accumulation system in the lobby, even if you don't do any fights or tasks, you can level up once per day, since the system levels up its rewards amounts with your player levels. The game maxing the assist hunters' level at the Sung Jinwoo's current level is pretty smart, since you can't pour all your resources into one character to just bypass the whole game with a single character. Overall, they did a great job making the game.",5,2024-12-31 15:51:37

A Google user,"This game is a complete disaster on iOS. It crashes CONSTANTLY—during fights, in the middle of loading screens, and just randomly when you’re about to make progress. Hours of gameplay gone in an instant. I’ve tried everything to fix it—restarting, reinstalling, clearing cache—nothing works. The devs don’t seem to care, and there’s no word on a fix. If you’re looking to enjoy Solo Leveling, don’t bother on iOS. It’s an absolute mess and a huge waste of time.",1,2024-12-20 19:09:08

A Google user,"It's a really good game but on mobile, its so buggy it becomes unplayable. My screen keeps turning black, when I summon it's a black screen and every sound loops over eachother like 2 times a second making it sound like something is about to blow up. The only way to fix it is by restarting the game but it takes quite a while to load back and it sometimes gets so bad it goes black before you even load into the game. It's perfectly fine on PC but on my phone it's unplayable.",3,2024-12-19 23:29:52
A Google user,Why isn't this Editor's Choice yet?! This is one of the best gacha games out there right now. Giving out so many rewards and compensation while simultaneously fixing bugs.

A Google user,"Fight system is very fun, unfortunately the controls can be unresponsive and there are obvious lags (most now fixed!) Its also very monotised and packs are expensive. So many ways to level its actually annoying. But super generous on rewards and events so dont worry about progress walls. Other than that it has some nice graphics. Its good for a mob game, you could be f2p, just dont expect to get good stuff in community events as these are still p2w, and slow growth but mixed with events.",4,2024-12-19 22:23:47

A Google user,"I played 7DS for a few years on and off having having stopped when the bloat out grew the series. I am a fan of solo and thought Arise would be excellent but holds the same bad experiences 7DS had. Loads of lag, a game that requires far too space for mobile and endless load screens. If netmarble just refined the games to be on Steam on a pc platform, they would be amazing. The bloat and power creep are expected but would easier to cope with on pc",2,2024-12-04 02:45:39

A Google user,The game is actually 9 out of 10 The story is great . Gameplay is not bad but need some improvements. Upgrades and other resources is easy to grind and enjoyable But one annoying problem is the stucks in loadings! I don't know if it's just for me or others have this problem too but its really annoying because the main game loading is a bit long and everytime my game stuck in levels loading i have to restart the game ! Developers please fix this problem otherwise the game is perfect,5,2024-12-02 04:58:19

It's a lot easier to grind compared to back then, but the exact same thing that made me quit years ago still plagues the game now.

I have no other choice but to salvage it. Also It's close to my dream game, it's just that there are no other players to interact with. It reminds me of anime that always have adventure guilds, which makes it different from Solo Leveling, so that's fine with me. Overall, the game is really good.",5,2024-11-29 17:03:55

A Google user,The fact that It keeps doing that weird loading circle every time I enter a different page is frustrating. All in all pretty good to play. update: It has become better as some loading times have been removed. Still I think its 4 star as the loading circles are still too much. Edit: Much better than before. No problem I can see.The fact that the reward from free coin is just 5000 coins (in shop); I seriously feel it's not enough.,5,2024-11-29 00:33:17

A Google user,I had fun playing this game but for some reason(idk which update it was) this game has been crashing left and right. Sometimes I cant even load into the game. Sometimes the game completely loads from the title screen and lets me play for a few minutes then crashes out of nowhere. I humbly enjoy the game when I get a chance(no matter how miniscule) to play but the game crashes are a pain.,2,2024-11-27 22:33:09

A Google user,"The game itself is pretty good, it's fun and enjoyable, it does somewhat stick to the story of the webtoon, which is great. But on one note, it needs a serious optimization, not just because of the loading screens, but the whole game overall. It has good graphics and all, but it is extremely heavy and lags a lot, which is kind of a pain. Other than that, I really like the game, except for the fact that it becomes a bit repetitive at some point (fights and scenarios).",2,2024-11-27 22:12:36

A Google user,Gacha game done right. Best mobile gacha game that I've played. They listen to the community for suggestions. They care about the game and this cannot be stressed enough. They care and it shows. There are MANY opportunities to spend money and it definitely helps your gameplay but what I appreciate is that you're not punished for not spending money like most games. The smart thing they've done is they've tiered the difficulty so that at all content is accessible at various gameplay levels.,5,2024-11-27 20:16:17

A Google user,"5 stars so you can read this. ""solo leveling"" but you have helpers *thumbs down*. still i thought that it was a passable game until i got stuck on story for exp, having to wait for days to keep leveling up and be able to start higher level missions. why do you even sell exp? let me guess this is another non-skill based game that wastes ""perfect dodge"" and stuff from real action games. advice for homies: don't play this if you liked God Eater Burst.",5,2024-11-27 16:19:44

A Google user,"Playing this game since day 3, or 4. Game of the year? Yeah right. The most devious and manipulative app there is right now. They let you through the campaign and so, but the endgame content is where they get ya. You breeze through some endgame stage, and by the next server restart, the team makes sure u can never do that again. Unless u chip in, that is. Even stronger, nope, u cannot repeat that win. Do NOT get me started on draw rates. The worst one I have ever seen. U never get anything.Shame",1,2024-11-27 10:18:09

My Samsung S21+ heated up just enough to cook 2 eggs on it and it was delicious. Storyline was exactly to the letter and the stylish visuals were breathtaking. I enjoyed the sub-bassline in the story, a big plus and i heard it in the MC's ult, very good. Overall i truly enjoyed every bit of the game since first launch...with the crashes, freezes and lags.",5,2024-11-24 17:56:26

There are plenty of pay to win elements available for whales, but with all the freebies, and a $5 off coupon, I'm level 36 and running out of resources before I hit a wall in difficulty. Also, this story is soooo good. It is incredible, I cannot progress in it unless I have my headphones. The voice acting is great, the cutscenes are amazing.

A Google user,So far it's fun to play. They are some glitches but for me they aren't so bad (except the buffering one when it happens). The game is generous with the gifts they give you. The one thing I find is you eventually get to a point where you hit a wall and it's hard to progress (for me its lack of dupes for my hunters the MC can carry them through certain things but on hunter only stuff it's a no go. I wouldn't mind mildly spending on the game but most shop stuff is extremely overvalued imo.,5,2024-11-17 16:35:26

A Google user,Game is perfect but there is one thing that I didn't like that much and that is timing system in the match because it was not in anime or manhwa. It's just an annoying feature maybe they can use fatigue system like in manhwa to get match more intense like by adding fatigue in specific skills like critical attack or extreme invasion and they can at least also give status recovery one in a day which can remove all fatigue and damage. But this timing system destroy all wives of solo leveling.,4,2024-11-05 11:04:37

A Google user,"The in game story is a lot of fun and it rewards you for completing the main quests. There is a subscription option which is helpful but not necessary due to all the crafting materials earned in the story quests. The new guild system is great for new players. My phone is 4 years old and handles the app well, it just eats through battery after a few hours of continous play. They have an auto mode which is good for lower level quests but the harder difficulties requires more player involvement",5,2024-10-31 12:52:13

A Google user,I really wanna like this but when you charge gold to swap out gear you already own you are basically trying to bankrupt the player constantly and trying to force them to spend real money to buy fake gold...... It's stupid why would it cost 20k gold to take off your clothes!! Edit10/24 they kinda made it better random times to allow free gear swapping but still a pain in the butt I can swap skills and weapons but not the Rings associated with the weapons new element and if I ring swap cost gold,2,2024-10-31 08:30:28

As you go through the game, things get harder, and you'll need more items just to play, and you have to do everything twice as long, meaning it takes too much time. One other thing is the chances.

Good work to the creators of this game Its fun and interesting to play I nearly got addicted to the game sometime ago The only issue I have with the game is about the story mode difficulty Sometimes you can't move forward to the next chapter because even though you have a higher level buh u may still get defeated I know u are still working on the improvement of the game and I really appreciate that very much,5,2024-10-18 07:29:19

However, the beginning can feel a bit restrictive as you're forced to play through several chapters of the tutorial, which is not optional.

Whether you're switching between characters, opening a drawer, or navigating from one part of the game to another, each action triggers a loading screen, which disrupts the flow. This definitely needs to be addressed to improve the overall experience.",4,2024-10-15 20:09:13

A Google user,I am repositioned myself as I played this game for some time on my previous mobile devices and my pc. I found this game very resource hungry and it is really power consuming for pc that is basically played via emulator. The graphics details are ok but it wasn't worth against gameplay. Even with a 40 Mbps connection I frequently find loading screen more often. I think this game needs more refine to be played in many more devices. You can make a game that looks good or plays good.,2,2024-10-13 13:30:42

The recent changes on the workshop of brilliant light rewards day 1 players because the Curse set equipment was removed. You can still get it from a different mode but very hard to farm now. Before you can get epic grade curse equipment by hitting 250-300k power. New players can only catch up with day1 players through pay to win option. I'm 40 days into the game and started good but hitting a wall now due to the said change.,3,2024-10-12 21:38:44

A Google user,6/10/24 they sold a character with a skill to break shield(Meilin) and now her skill does not work breaking the shield anymore. Making players buy and now nerfing her only use in a team. 24/09/24 its annoying the game lags and the game speeds up to catch up and then game suspects that you are cheating and gets you ban. Everytime that happens i exit out of the game just to not get banned hopefully.,1,2024-10-06 05:39:49

As much as I'd love to play, it is annoying to restart MORE THAN 7x just to clear the daily 15 gates. Please fix.",3,2024-10-05 23:36:13

There is a lot to do and many events to keep you occupied until you hit end game when it gets a bit boring tbh.

A Google user,"The game is really well implemented. It has a good gameplay and great graphics and for the user, they can choose to play as the main character or even try a side character. It has various modes and challenges and the story mode is also quite fun. The only major problem for me is the issue with the loading page, it sometimes freezes and the mission or story won't go further and the user has to close the game nd reopen it again. Otherwise,there's some minor bugs and glitches in the gameplay too.",5,2024-09-29 02:34:11

Just getting to the lobby is almost 5 minutes, and since the last big update you have to wait through about an extra 10 seconds after you go through a menu or really clicking on anything that's not fighting. Adds at least another 10-15 minutes it feels like when just going through the main daily stuff. Fun game but man is it ever getting rough to justify staying on.

A Google user,Game controls not consistent. Dodge mechanics still need improvement. Team set up randomly changes in different game modes. One moment I'm using a Fire focused team and then it changes to a different one. Game is mostly pay to win (or rank up). You'll need subscriptions to get a certain percentage of additional gold. Characters will be recycled only given different costumes and such.,2,2024-09-24 20:15:40

A Google user,The actual game is good but the load times are horrible. The biggest thing after that would be purchases. If you want to even level up at a decent rate you have to pay subscriptions in game and there is not just a single one you would have to do multiple subscriptions. This also includes how long you have to spend to get everything done after each reset. It takes around 2 to 3 hours to get everything done even with auto battle.,3,2024-09-23 20:39:15

Graphics are so good in the lowest settings and the game is really smooth in my weak phone. The progress is being felt because you can easily play 3 hours a day and have no problem. Combat can get a bit better if all the character talking in-between would go. Also the luck of summons have to get better.the ui feels kinda weird so if they fix that but it's still a great game,4,2024-09-22 18:20:42

And the most annoying part of the game for is that sometimes my screen does not load when logging in or when i try clearing gates and the story.

S22 Galaxy Edit again: giving it 1 because it's unplayable without restarting over and over again, goes black screen after every ""story"" segment and restarting takes a while only for it to black screen after every mission",1,2024-09-17 15:04:22

A Google user,I like the game pretty much because its an anime based with story gameplay but I think its still need some more things from the original anime in the game like 1.Tusk ( sung jinwoo's shadow) having a slot for Orb of Avarice which gives more power 2.Igris ( sung jinwoo's shadow) having a slot for sword like weapons 3. Free Training lobby where we can use and get practiced,5,2024-09-17 14:45:59

A Google user,This would be a great game if the loading screens wouldn't stop loading. I have to keep closing the game so I can carry on. Please fix the glitches on the loading screens because apart from that I actually love the game. Update: after level 4 the English dub isn't complete with the subtitles. Big chucks of audio are missing. Game freezes and ends up on a blank screen before fighting some of the bosses so I have to restart the game. Please fix these issues.,3,2024-09-15 19:50:48

A Google user,"Downloaded this game based on a highly positive review from StewGaming on Youtube...my mistake. The game is slow to load. When you buy items or claim free items in the shop, there's a 6-second progess wheel. The game has crashed on me twice, last time was leveling up skills. This game has the new feature where, yes, you get like a 100 free draws, but you only get to keep one set out of all of them. You have to buy the rest for $10 if you want to keep them. Graphics are GREAT, but that's about it",2,2024-09-09 21:31:39

You name a transition, it hangs/crashes on every transition. thier unusual play detection is the worst, it detects just in-game bugs and blocks us from any ranking activities.

A Google user,"I played the game for about an hour and I think I've seen enough of it to make up my mind: pretty interesting that you can have the game auto play for you, the few times I let the game take control, 40% of the time it crashes. I actively play 4 other gachas, and my initial impression is that this game shoves monetization down your throat. I'm sure it's deep and better as you invest more time, but from everything I've experienced, I can't get into it.",2,2024-09-05 08:44:15

I might quit in the near future if there's no update on the difficulty of the game. If it's easy make it easy, if it's normal make it normal. Quality of Life is important too.",1,2024-09-04 19:10:14

I had been playing this game for 117 days, they deleted all my rankings and banned me for 30 days just because of their graphics glitches. Their so called AI system detects it's as you are using some kind of hack to play. I had played fairly throughout and in the end they reward their hunters by deleting their rankings and banning them for 30 days for registering new ranks.

A Google user,Game has too many bugs on mobile. Some damage are not registering. Even having a good device still wont be able to keep up with PC players due to limited FPS. Compared this on the same account using PC and mobile and the difference is overwhelming. The dragon falls too slowly compared to PC on PoD and like mentioned some damage aren't registering properly. This ain't fair for most mobile users if you're not able to get on PC to do BoT and PoD runs. The perma loading and black screen is also bad.,4,2024-09-03 15:22:49

First, even on the lowest graphics settings game usually runs so poorly that you can't tell what's going on on the screen and the second reason is that some levels, whether it's main storyline or some challenge stage, it feels like it's made so you deliberately loose.

A Google user,This is a very good game in fact it became on of my favorites but the only downside is the bugs. the game freeze when you try to play gate/dungeon etc. I aslo notice that when it bugs you have to delete the game and download it again or it won't. I went to play the game so I delete the game and download it again just to play it it was a new development game so it was common for ther to be bugs. but after 100 days pass it still the same. please fix it because it's actually a top tier game.......,1,2024-08-29 02:32:09

A Google user,"I changed my review from 1 to 3 stars because they improved. There're still other critical flaws that have been making players leave. Firstly, the reason we play is because we're Solo Level fans, not waifus. There're better waifu games that focus on those. Secondly, you must remember that the gacha community consist of majority casual especially mobile players. The reason for your decline is because people don't have confidence to spend on skill-based heavy endgame. No one likes to pay-2-lose.",3,2024-08-25 18:28:44

A Google user,I got this game when it first came out and I went put some money into it because I just really wanted to lvl up my characters and have a fun time. But even with the lowest settings it's still laggy. It jitters and if you care about dodging then be prepared to be annoying at the controls for it. Game also randomly locks you into the loading circle and won't finish loading unless you restart. And starting today I've even had to restart IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOSS BATTLE. I was literally 30% away.,1,2024-08-19 15:13:15

A Google user,Simple. Its P2W game. Almost everything uses money and its hard to gain a lot of money in the game. Same goes to upgrade material and artifact. Unless I have to spend real money on the game. Even I cant complete limited time event because my characters are still on low level and you guys didnt give some trial characters?Sucks. Just tell em this game not for free-to-play player. This game just for who have money.,1,2024-08-15 19:46:38

A Google user,"Such a great game when it works. I hadn't had any issues until around a week or two ago. Random connection to server drops and disconnected. The last few days the game has been unplayable. I am unable to get through the second loading screen before it disconnects or has a server connection issue. I've missed 4 days of daily login items, 4 days of xp and other rewards. Also I pay a subscription so haven't been able to use my sweeps or claim the draws I've gained. I've tried everything to fix 😭",2,2024-08-10 16:47:00

A Google user,"Full Game Review as f2p Pros - SSRS easy to get as u get essence. stones pretty easily , with proper hardwork easy to clear most of the story, devs gives freebies Cons - can't clear latest story( hidden chapters) coz of power lvl , new instance dungeons and encore missions are hard to clear (lvl 10), cost of gold is way toouch for everything. So after playing it for this long without a break I can say as f2p u can easily clear most of things but new stories won't be easy to clear.",4,2024-08-10 11:54:51

Even times where 'I' will spawn outside the dungeon or not all the assist hunters will appeared in game play. Hopefully it will get fix soon.

A Google user,"The story line and graphics are good. But, as everyone here said, very bad lags and takes forever to load. I see 100+ same comments, and the idiot game developers team says check you connection. You guys need to check your brain. Resign please, let professionals improve the game. The experience is pathetic. Our internet and our devices are best in class. Check your servers. I encourage people to give 1 star to get their delusion of grandeur down the hill and listen to player base.",1,2024-08-08 12:15:46
A Google user,Game is 100% becoming p2w and nothing we do will stop it. Once the September update hits you will need 1million power to play regular story mode. 90% or even 98% of the entire playerbase won't be able to even touch that and that includes f2p early access players. Even moderate spenders will be punished for not being a whale. The summer event can't be finished by new players so that is a really bad sign. Starting to not have any hope in this game. Will update if I'm wrong on the future.,1,2024-08-08 11:41:00

A Google user,The game is cool. The only issue I have is your guys's Pull rate is ridiculous especially for SSR characters. Even though you guys have support abilities for us to get SSR stuff can never land a decent SSR character which is pretty crazy. I appreciate the free SSR but I want to earn my ssr characters through summonings other than that what's the point point of having a support SSR pull if you can't even pull an SSR character?,5,2024-08-02 08:42:57

And further more the extension pack is more than 8Gb which makes it a little difficult to play on mobile.and the graphics are too damn good even on the low settings. A solution to reduce lag can be giving a option to toggle animation on and off for both lobby and in game chapter.

A Google user,This new summer update is pathetic. The connection is sluggish and interferes with the game. This is the problem of playing the game in real time. The game is sluggish at best and sometimes you have to replay all over again. The game should be play in batches not real time and have a period of updating in real time. Playing in real time that's lagging and the terrible summer update has left a horrible taste in my mouth.,1,2024-08-01 14:30:14

All the time go 70+ pulls to get a SSR when f2p but if you pay you get SSR faster within 20-30 pulls. Sometimes 2-3 hunters from 10 pulls if paid. I payed a little in one account and f2p other. Totally no beginner nor f2p friendly. All new content are for end gamers. Every content we get something are getting harder.,1,2024-08-01 13:24:29

A Google user,Best RPG game I've ever played. I usually delete a RPG game after playing someday because of there's nothing to horn your skills because you can just spam your skills and when the boss attack you can't dodge but in this game you can actually improve your skills because there's so many skills to learn and you can also dodge bosses attack so that's why for me this game is by far better than any other RPG game,5,2024-08-01 11:36:41

A Google user,"A detailed review after sometime. The major issue of loading got fixed greatly but of course not absolutely which is still a great facility for players. Still another great issue is growing of low end devices(starting from 6 - 8 GB RAM), it's becoming impossible to play on Such devices. Great game of course but Still needs to be improved a bit.

A Google user,The game is awesome! Just do some things for the Android version. 1) Switch to touchscreen controls permanently for all Androids. I always have to set the Gamepad mode to touchscreen before playing. It's annoying. 2) Fix the thermals: The temperature of my phone crosses 43⁰C after just 10 minutes of playtime. I have Redmi K50i which is a high end phone and is easily able to handle the game even on highest graphics. But this heating issue is making the game slow eventually.,5,2024-07-30 23:52:11

And some the daily claim event the reward seen to be cleamed but the reward was not in my character invontry. The costume service in the game seems to be ai.I just contacted the costume support in the game twice and the answer was same you have already recieved the reward it's in youinvontry... But I can find the reward(SSR CHARACTER),1,2024-07-25 23:58:24

A Google user,"Great game, great animation, the art and graphics are good. I just have two problems, 1. The loading time is too much. 2. The story mode is just the same thing as anime and manga, and since the auto mode can do everything, it's pretty boring. I feel like if we were given a separate character with separate weapon, style, skills it would have been better. 3. get rid of auto mode, or atleast make it only available after you finish a level. 4. Make the game harder, it shouldn't be that easy.",4,2024-07-25 22:40:21
A Google user,Have been playing this game for 45 days. The rates in the game sucks. Getting good artifacts is almost impossible. Not to mention you'll get useless stats here and there. I just wish I can reroll stats on my artifacts. The rewards on some events also suck especially the growth event. Like seriously 250 essence stones and 50k gold for an event that requires a lot of resources? The game also feels repetitive when you cross the level 50 mark. Every fight just feels the same.,1,2024-07-25 21:53:34

A Google user,"7 out of 10. The game has many positives going for it. Good characters, interesting story, grinding is easy to manage, getting materials for upgrades is easy and straight forward. However there are a few flaws that hold the game back. The first is that attaining the rebel leader is insanely difficult, getting gems requires money, playing the reverse mode and hard mode is way more challenging and requires more time to upgrade hunters which limits the games replyability and bosses are repetitive.",4,2024-07-25 08:06:47

A Google user,So far so good. I know it's fairly new but once it gets a little more optimized it'll be one of my top games on my phone for sure. It can get laggy on phones that it definitely shouldn't be even when playing with the graphics settings i.e S22 and Pixel 6 pro. Update. Game freezes during quests making it impossible to enjoy and play. It's been over 2 months and still the same issue. Uninstalled until I know it's fixed,3,2024-07-22 10:48:33

A Google user,Expensive game to even progress and false bans really discourage you. As a solo game I'm completely clueless as to what I was banned for but they have me locked out for a month. Safe to say I'll be canceling my monthly pass and won't be continuing my journey in this game. Love the anime but this game left a bad taste in my mouth for the solo leveling franchise. 1 star and believe me if I could make it Lower I would. Such a joke to be banned and get a renewal notice for the stupid monthly sub. 🗑,1,2024-07-22 08:02:14

You will often hit a wall because your power is too low to progress, while the items you get are not enough and will have to grind endlessly until you get something good. Also, the game loads for just about anything, if you walk, loads, blink, loads, change menu, loads, anything.

My experience: after a 45 minutes tutorial (unskippable you just click where you are told) I got showered by an endless amount of offers and in-game purchases. Then I manage to start playing the game and discover that you literally have the option of not playing at all (by activating the auto option for movement and combat).

Gameplay would have looked nice if it was stable, played for 2 min, then it crashed.

A Google user,"It's decent but needs optimization. Very money hungry with 3 different subscriptions and a battle pass along with a premium currency you can only buy. You can have fun as a f2p, a decent amount of freebies in the beginning... but after a while, it's quite a boring grind. Progress is gated by player level, so at times, there's nothing you can do but wait for afk exp sometimes, so there's also that. 2 stars is mostly for how predatory the game is, but that's how I personally feel.",2,2024-07-12 19:08:55

AI is still really stupid, doding is terrible as you can't control the direction for some reason on mobile, and projectile dodging is terrible.

A Google user,"The game is quite interesting. Controls and graphics are really good, but the worst part is ""too much loading."" Every time you come to the lobby or open a crate or collect rewards or whatever you do, it has to reload to interact with the same interface you were just using. It's annoying as hell! (No issues with the device since it's running on one of the latest flagships🤷🏻‍♂️) Ps. - Devs have fixed the issue with the latest update. Good job guys, Thanks🤝🏻",3,2024-07-11 03:35:13

A Google user,Not good for android it's not open in my phone it's get close again and again,1,2024-07-11 00:52:01
A Google user,"The main issue is the constant freezing. The leveling system isn't bad but is very difficult to grind unless you're committed every day for resources such as weapon experience. The rewards feel lackluster with the amount of materials needed to progress. I would still recommend giving this game a go, but I wouldn't invest too heavily unless you have the resources to afford it since F2P is brutal on progression. Enjoyable, yes, but I will remain casual knowing max level equipment is out of reach.",3,2024-07-11 00:50:59

From black screens to long loading times between cutscenes and transitions, it's just a pain to play. When I don't skip the cutscenes it just leaves a black screen that's lasts more than 30 seconds.

A Google user,It's a good game but there are not enough characters so even if you don't pull a ssr there are not enough other characters to make pulling one feel special.

A Google user,This game is absolutely stunning in beautiful graphics. Special moves look awesome. Story mode is good. And good amount of side stuff to let you grind and level up. Do wish the loading pop up wasn't there every time I looked into different categories. But it is a minor inconvenience for how enjoyable this gem is. The crashing issues have happened less often as well. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves this type of gaming. I doubt you will be disappointed. Thank you developers. U rock.,5,2024-07-10 12:06:50
A Google user,"Well one of best game I have played ,as it's a new and under development i believe the bugs(unnecessary loading,slider sometime doesn't respond as when I open the menu slider and try to click and option like shopping or any of the option it does select) which are left in it which i believe will be resolved later",4,2024-07-10 12:03:43
A Google user,"Fun game, but I have to restart the game after every level. Edit: I don't have the problem where i have to restart every level anymore and my only complaint is that some levels in the campaign are locked behind level requirements, so you have to grind gates and side story missions to progress even if you have the recommended total power or more. Still a good game overall and would recommend to anyone who likes gacha games that have great fast-paced combat.",5,2024-07-10 12:03:14

A Google user,No doubt this game is awesome but there is some things that I didn't like. 1st they give your character 3 sprints seriously it's not enough when youre fighting with a high level boss and it's enemy marking sometimes sucks. Instead of nearby enemy my character marks on enemy automatically which is far away and whenever you came back from any dungeon or story mission it's always starting refreshing everytime and that's irritating if anyone from developer reading this pls fix these things.,4,2024-07-10 11:20:20

A Google user,"Great graphics, art and audio quality. The controls aren't great. Dodging and countering enemy attacks requires extreme precision. The usable characters are impressive, but it doesn't tell you what the skills do without studying every character. Typical gacha draw system with expected rarity rates. (140 draws to get 1 good draw) But the deal breaker for me is the never ending loading time, and checking with the server spinning wheel of death.

But once you reached the later half, the game spikes on difficulty, significantly a lot more grinding and heavy time investment needed, a.k.a the boring phase. My problem is, I don't see much potential on future development on the game. Maybe it just giving too much, too soon.",3,2024-07-10 09:07:23

A Google user,Good game. Not full stars because I personally despise any game that forces you through 30 minutes of tutorial with no personal freedom and practically tapes your eyelids open for even the simplest menu items that you could have explored yourself with little to no problem.,3,2024-07-09 16:37:49

A Google user,The game is great but it has some flaws like items being to expensive and ad pop ups and loading to long but I can't really argue. Why cuz the game is in mobile so it runs smooth but it forces to process fps and it overheats the phone. And overall its a good game but i hate the perfect dodge and you can't upgrade it wished the cooldown wasn't 4sc but an the otherhand makes it harder and plays with your mind. And gonna wait until they add it to consoles. and that's my review rate 8.5/10.,5,2024-07-09 13:55:16

Have to close the game to fix it and it skips around when returning back. Graphics looks like an old early 2000's game, backgrounds in game are super blocky and rough. The enemies designs are super rough and hard to tell what it is. Fun game for action but definitely not gonna recommend it because how buggy it is.",1,2024-07-09 11:32:25

A Google user,After recent update the game has gotten worse. Constant loading/lagging issue like everyone else. And now there's popup after every match to try to get you to spend money. In game gold is very scarce and everything cost a ton of gold to level up. They even make it cost gold to unequip items if you level it up past a certain level. Game is starting to feel more like a chore than fun. Daily repeated grind which you can't even sweep for fast co completion and no pvp content.,1,2024-07-07 07:06:15

A Google user,"Stylised violence never looked so good. Definitely p2w but has enough content to keep f2p busy. It's a dungeon type game not open world and the grind is definitely prevalent mid-game to end-game. You receive keys daily to do several dungeons and once the keys are used up, either stop playing, try push the story, use gems/money for more keys. Decent game if you like the solo levelling universe. One gripe with the game is the annoying loading circle and may deter you from playing this game.",4,2024-07-06 12:51:44

A Google user,I actually love the details the game has picked..In the story mode the animations from the manhwas are top notch with extremely good graphics. Just you need to grind and the with some luck you can get great rewards. Just make sure that the game has some heating issues like if u play in normal graphics the phone will start to heat within 10-15 minutes of playtime.. Otherwise the game is top notch,5,2024-07-06 02:27:22

A Google user,I expected more from it. If you have already watched Solo Levelling anime then this is going to be boring for you. And on top it this game doesn't let you play on your own. This is filled with tutorials and cut scenes. There is no freedom to explore this game. Graphics and animations are good fights too. If you have not watched Solo Levelling anime then you might enjoy it.,2,2024-07-05 21:38:13

A Google user,"Great gameplay, but it has a few issues. The RNG on artefacts is very bad. There's a lot of grinding to get the stat you want, and when you upgrade artifacts, it always upgrades the substation you don't want upgraded. I think it should let you choose what substation to upgrade when you reach lv5, 10, etc. Secondly, the FPS drops severely even on the lowest graphics settings. This needs to be optimised better as the FPS actually affects the DPS in game and prevents me clearing stages in time.",3,2024-07-05 14:22:07

Come on man my graphics are low and every time I press the next button or retry button it stucks at the loading screen every time and whenever it happens I need to restart the game just to fix it and it's ruining the excitement.,2,2024-07-04 22:43:40

A Google user,"It's got the story going for it which was ripped from the anime. Character pull rates are awful, item drop rates are even worse, and there is little to no way to interact with other players. Auto farming doesn't work on half the content so you must actually grind out several hours of content daily to try to keep up with the gear requirements. Codes for the game are distributed through content creators which has lead to them monetizing free rewards which is crazy. Character limit, sorry.",1,2024-07-04 02:08:02

A Google user,Focusing on money making game. Hard to gather tickets for draws. The draw system is dang boring. Hard to get heroes and rare equipments in draws. (takes weeks of farming) kinda boring. Hard to get stronger. No wonder this game had no ads or maybe just a few. No free draws etc. it's just a hype anime and great anime. So maybe that's why many wanted to try this game. Overall animation and combat style is great. Needs a lot of improvements. Developers please think and care about your players.,2,2024-07-03 02:44:38

A Google user,Very satisfying game but the reverse chapter mode has no exp gain its a real let down. And when lavaling up the power gain is very low around 100 to 200 power up only a artifact upgrade gives more power working hard to level up and no noticeable change on power is sad. And need more ways to find weapons not only draw like a tournament or something. Other wise graphic and story line going along with the play is perfect.,5,2024-06-29 18:06:49

A Google user,If you want to re watch the episodes out this is all it's for. They dropped the ball. No creativity when they re make a nine games. Rather than letting us create a character in the solo leveling world we could upgrade and grind dungeons and make it our own. You re play the show basically just do what he did in the show as him. You don't go off on your own or choose your path just forced to replay like the show. Boring as he'll not well thought out. Who keeps making these? We want to be in these?,1,2024-06-29 07:02:08

Animations is very basic, they also use scenes from the manhwa instead of using their 3d models which to me is very lazy and a turn off. The auto feature is also very stupid. Sure it can attack but it can't dodge so what's the point. It also very requires alot of grinding. Some if not most of the artwork look like AI art",1,2024-06-28 23:32:06

If you don't pay, you get stuck behind level barriers and not having correct elemental supporting hunters or weapons, you can't unlock shadows without waiting for a long time. You have to clear gates which you get 10-15ish a day unless you pay for keys to do more.

A Google user,"First off, it's your typical gacha game. Gives you enough to feel like you're getting somewhere until suddenly you hit a hard paywall or grind for absurdly low rate ssr drops. Combine this with long load times and a constant load refresh whenever you are in home base makes this just another to throw money at. The 'end game' isn't all that interesting and only viable if you get extremely lucky or throw money.Play it until you finish the chapters then move on. Nothing ground breaking to see here.",2,2024-06-27 19:39:24

A Google user,Gameing experience is very nice... But in story mode it's getting very less time to finish the level... Also the more we level up its getting harder. And what is the use of wepons if they don't use for unters..... High damage wepons are for sung only. While in the middle of battle in the boss level the game is lagging and can't do much damage at that time.please fix this,4,2024-06-27 17:01:31

I've played Genshin, Star rail and Honkai. All games equally or more complicated than this one.

A Google user,"Constant forced direction play. You get weapons that you can't equip or upgrade, funds that you can't collect, upgrade points that you can't allocate and more... The tutorial lasts forever, constantly forcing you to only go where it says to go. Even when it takes you to the funds to explain, you can't collect them... You're forced to start a ""free"" 3 day trial but can you explore or make use of it? Nope. Forced away.",1,2024-06-25 07:37:39

A Google user,"It's the same as any other games. Gacha, auto play, level up weapons, etc. It's so boring. You do the same thing of fighting monsters each level.

It's impossible to play on mobile at this point.

Give the option to skip tutorials for people who don't want to do them. I'd understand if the tutorial was on the first few stages, but continuing on into Chapter 2? Absurd.",1,2024-06-25 02:13:58

A Google user,"Fantastic game! Revert gamer's dream is to have a lore-accurate video game, and this one is just perfect. Great visuals,gameplay is actually fun (and can be punishing in a good way). Quite balanced for a Gasha game. My complaints -and everyone who played it so far- is that the loading time is horrendous, sometimes the levels/portals go a little crazy & kindda stop following the rules (sometimes the character you're playing as would stop responding to your input) & (sometimes the enemies do too).",5,2024-06-25 01:03:41

A Google user,Basically the game is good and one of the most facinating game I've ever played but the main issue with this game is it takes a lot of time during updates. Also the story mode in the game is only play worthy coz the rewards in story mode are good but other modes are mostly useless and less fun. Also in story mode Igris is too hard to beat and without 2 SSR weapon and 3 SSR hunter you can't beat him which makes us feel unworthy and feel like we shouldn't play the game and so many quitted the game,3,2024-06-23 16:13:45

First the loading, and I'm not talking about the initial loading to enter the game. To go to different sections within the game, it just loads unnecessarily long. Second, they introduced this in-game ads like feature that disturbs you everynow and then, and the rewards isn't even worth mentioning.

A Google user,"Might as well be unplayable. Half the time it's constantly ""loading"" between every little thing. Seeing that spinning circle every time you do something is annoying. The most tedious part is when the game while doing missions will just straight up stutter and stop. Can't back out can touch anything but can hear characters like they are still fighting. These issues have been there since day one and need to be fixed. It gets to the point now when it does that on a mission I won't play for a bit",1,2024-06-22 02:55:20
A Google user,"Game seems okay, but the first few levels appear to be played with no interaction needed, and it over heated pretty fast. All the ""awards"" seem like all the same stuff from similar games. Feels to me like a reskin of a failed game with minimal tweeking and more interactive tv show/Manga rather then a video game. I'm aware someone will state that ""it gets better"" or ""just wait"" I reply to them, why must I click skip over 100 times before any actual game play?",2,2024-06-22 02:41:31

A Google user,"Overall, while Solo Leveling excels in graphics, controls, and immersive storytelling, it faces notable issues in its upgrade mechanics and game flow, which may affect long-term player satisfaction. Having played Genshin Impact for the past two years,Genshin Impact offers a more generous loot and drop rate system for character upgrades, making progression smoother for free-to-play (F2P) players. In contrast, upgrading skills beyond level 7 in Solo Leveling is challenging for F2P players .",3,2024-06-21 19:00:56

A Google user,(i am on a phone btw) but the game is really fun good story as always. I am a big fan of the anime and manga. The only issues i have is the game doesnt seem to be built for phones it gets super laggy even on lowest graphical settings and closes on itself. Secondly theres a loading issue in the game you click on one thing and it pops up a circle loading for like 5 seconds or so even if you were just on that page and went back its pointless and makes no sense and annoying.,3,2024-06-21 03:58:01

A Google user,Decent if you know the plot. It could've been better though. The first chapter goes way too fast and it feels like you're just tapping through the story and not really playing. It's too easy and if you didn't read the comic or watch the show you get lost in the intro it's too fast. They could have drawn out the dungeon at least and let you earn titles yourself rather than going through the motions. Also the draw should have been shadows! Not people. As jinwo is mostly solo it doesn't make sense,3,2024-06-20 11:08:05

A Google user,"This is an amazing game for SL fans and even for those who're looking to try new RPG mage based games. But the only problem with this is that the game is HEAVILY dependant on artefacts and the artefacts have poor gacha. Without decent artefacts, you would neither have stats not total power to progress in the stories. And the way to get epic artefacts is boring (encore and instance dungeons). Skills, player level and weapons are all secondary and barely contribute to the total power of hunters",4,2024-06-19 12:37:14

A Google user,"Update: The developers seem to listen to the community and implicated several QOL improvements. The game plays a bit smoother now with fewer crashes. However the biggest issue is the lack of resources you can get. Gold, summon stones (essences) materials to upgrade your shadows and more are kind of scarce. Even doing high end content like A and S gates net you next to nothing in compared to the amount of effort it takes. I'm not asking for handouts, but make it worth the time we spend in game.",4,2024-06-19 09:37:06

It feels like they are just pushing you through one tutorial after another when not everyone wants or needs that. I can understand the need to show players the system quickly so they can get to the meat of the gacha game thats been created but bomabarding them doesnt help.,1,2024-06-17 21:44:12

A Google user,There are few things that might be helpful which I elaborate below: Positive Points I) the graphics II) the gameplay III) different modes to explore the game IV) specifically the way they explain story of main character V) the animation of ultimate attack Negative Points I) game lag when internet is 🐌 II) additional files consume time when being downloaded III) take to much space of your device IV) heat up the device to much V) you have to tap fast which affect the touch of 📱,5,2024-06-16 23:13:01

Only the thing I request the devoloper is to increase the fight time in story mode as the more the level the harder are the enemies and there isn't much time to fight every single one of them as there are so many of them and all have way more health, I'm level 60 but still not able to clear the story fights of 52 lvl cause no of enemies is way lot and bosses also just smam attack so cannot dodge most of the attacks evenwithspam",4,2024-06-16 20:11:43

You open the mailbox, Bam! Loading. You tap one button, BAM! Loading. If you want to equip a weapon, you will encounter loading 3 times, the game is literal trash and broken. I think it is still in alpha to be honest. Go play any other game, they are way more enjoyable due to no lagging loading buffering every 1 second.",1,2024-06-16 19:49:45

A Google user,This is a 5 star game... unfortunately this game will frustrate you because the game doesn't flow outside of combat. there's a load time for anything you do outside of combat. The more you get into the game the more you'll notice the load time outside of combat. Eventually you'll start playing less and less until you no longer play and have gone back to the other games you like to play. Devs. You helped kill your own game by not making this a load free or buffer free game. You guys suck.,2,2024-06-16 17:27:07

A Google user,"When I first downloaded it, I thought it was fine until it stopped loading the game after a certain point (I guess I'll call it a tutorial). And then when I restarted the game, I clicked the first story, tried to skip because I already know the story, and the screen just became black. I'm disappointed because I can barely play the game. I won't rate it too low because I barely started but it's not a good start if this is happening. I might return to this game later if it gets better.",3,2024-06-13 21:54:17

A Google user,Although I enjoy quite a few aspects of the game. The loading circles constantly during the smallest things are really annoying. Power scaling isn't balanced towards content further in. Certain bosses/trials have broken abilities that at times deal too much damage that make it nearly impossible to 3 star or complete in general. Started having issues where the game would freeze during boss stages.,2,2024-06-13 21:12:37

Where the shadow still in the fight, not just appear for some time. This mechanism too isn't relate to jinwoo INT stats, where as the manga tell that the shadow stronger as the jinwoo INT stats.

A Google user,The predatory micro transactions could be forgiven if the power scaling wasn't a complete joke. My team was sitting at lvl 60 and having no problem with gates for weeks but suddenly a level 48 bug solos my squad. And I wish I could say it was close. The balance is clearly built to force you to buy power ups that give the smallest amount of support. I love the universe and the content surrounding it but this game is horrible if you take away the solo leveling skin and nobody should put money in.,1,2024-06-11 21:59:46

You get the hard mode which is basically playing the same old story but with a little bit of difficulty and then theres the reverse mode, which idk why is even there. Apart from that the instance dungeon and encore missions are also the same thing just again and again",4,2024-06-11 02:16:24

A Google user,"Absolutely unplayable. I get stuck in a black screen near the end of each mission. While it works again by restarting it, are you expecting me to restart each times it happens? It happened twice in the span of three minutes, and the count likely increases if I don't even bother to read the story. This easily forces me to restart constantly, and if I spend fifteen minutes on this game, half of that time would be me restarting the game. The positive reviews are clearly falsified.",1,2024-06-09 12:44:43

A Google user,Giving it a 4 star because the game makes you pay gold for changing high level artifacts when it reallg shouldn't. We don't know what artifacts to choose to get the best output right away and hence we try every one to choose the best but we can't do that if we have to spend gold all the time. Please remove this annoying feature.,4,2024-06-09 11:53:44

Graphics are incredible for a mobile title. Now onto the bad parts. The game is currently almost unplayable due to the constant freezing on a black loading screen and you have to restart the game in order to recover progress.

I give it 4 stars because the draw rates are awful. In draw you can get both characters or weapons, but the drop rate for characters is incredibly low (just .25%, and for the really good SSR characters is .04%, not even 1%) You need to do a 8 step of draws to get a SSR character ""guaranteed"".

Yes the gamplay is beautiful and the animation but the game is so unstable . It needs alot of stabilization and optimization and a new patch because this isn't it at all . I can't keep logging in 10 times every 5 seconds it's funny the same phone I use to play warzone when it gets to this game goes blank .

Three reasons: 1) The loading time needed after each click annoys real fast and is time consuming. 2) It's time consuming overall to just get through the daily tasks. 30 minutes to an hour. 3) Largest issue is the ridiculous pricing.

There are also an excessive amount of loading. Opening/closing a simple shop window takes a lot of time because of loading. The gameplay is fine. Haven't managed to play much because I load more than I play. Too long of a tutorial. The game has a giant page with all the info you need. No need for such a long tutorial.,1,2024-06-06 18:14:33

Also a lot of the materials required to get stronger either need real money or its upto total luck. Doesn't matter how many hunters you unlock cause you will never have the resources to get them up. Also lots of bugs like the boss monster just dissappearing into thin air and the buffering for EVERY SINGLE BUTTON i press.

The game is too grindy that it takes about 3 to 4 hours of your time to complete everything. The difficulty level is too steep particularly when you are against cerberus, ignis, and the 2 wolves.

Lastly just stop adding more health bars on the enemy and add some speed attacks and combo that's where the fun is or else it's just like we know each and every move,2,2024-06-05 00:20:36

Only difference is the difficulty and small boss skill changes when you move up in lvl My only issue is the ""LOADING TIME"" for mobile users. I spend half my time on a loading circle for every little thing I click on. Hoping this gets fixed because I am not able to play on a computer all the time. Makes it hard for what 15 min break I'm on to get any levels done. Thanks",3,2024-06-04 23:21:36

A Google user,"This game is something that I like , Accurate anime story, Weapons, Character design, graphics and multiple choice options but the main thing that it is stopping me from adding that extra star is the lag and Loading screen whenever I tap any button. This ruins the fun and enjoyment. I can reduce the lag by making the graphics and resolution low but how will counter the annoying loading screen whenever I tap any button.

A Google user,"Less crashing that's good, but the game needs dungeons that don't end on a time limit ones that u can truly grind out even if ur characters are lacking sufficient power level to beat it quickly. Give the other characters different play styles when equipping various weapons as well otherwise the weapon system For side characters might as well be converted into a rune system... The Play store for side characters should change if I use a staff, dagger, shield, or sword according to their class",3,2024-06-04 20:39:05
A Google user,Pretty fun game a little challenging but main reason I'm lowering at stars is because of the special summons because if you do the summons too early before you get your new ticket there's an expiration time and then you're locked out of it until the event is completely over even if you get your ticket after the expiration so now I'm going to be locked out of something I paid for just because I decided to do it a little bit early so that I could see what my choices were going to be,3,2024-06-04 20:38:08

The loading gets annoying because you have to wait a few seconds everytine you click out of a screen to the lobby area. Another issue is on the hard mode for the stories. The hard mode skips all the story parts and goes straight to the battles. Besides these issues, the game is great ! graphics wise and story wise !",4,2024-06-04 08:07:01
A Google user,Really enjoyed playing for the 1st week or so. Then got very difficult with very little advancing through the story missions. It's easy enough leveling up main character but having to pay for secondary npc characters skills and equipment leveling uses up available earned funds. They are much further behind in skills then the main character which makes some missions very difficult to complete. Still it's a great game. I did end up giving up. Not enough money earned from gates and missions.,5,2024-06-04 08:03:46

A Google user,I have lots of good things to say about the game but it has one huge glaring issue. One that makes it infuriating to play for more than 5 minutes. One that has made me not open the game for weeks. The insane loading. The main menus have buffering to the point that you're waiting on loading screens just to change small menus or menus within menus. When that's fixed this game will be a force to be reckoned with.,2,2024-06-04 03:51:33

A Google user,"Initial thoughts: game freezes very often. I have to restart the app, causing me to restart/redo the entire mission no matter my progress. The combat is also quite frusturating the auto lock on enemies just doesn't work about 70% of the time, so you end up using multiple abilities and hitting the air (you can't lock/focus onto enemies automatically to my knowledge). Better servers and a change to the autolock would greatly improve the game. I'm playing on the Galaxy s24+ 512 GB on 5G wifi.",2,2024-06-03 23:30:14

A Google user,"Game seems great. 3 problems to mention though: 1. The constant appearing of the blue circle buffering. It's worst if it's during combat, you just helplessly stare at your character being beaten by the enemy. 2. The ""Smart"" auto-lock isn't smart at all. It targets the enemy but attacks an empty space. 3. The game will suddenly go into a black screen and crash.",2,2024-06-03 23:05:47

The combat system is also fairly amazing and i love the fact that you can perfect dodge it just makes me feel cool. The games mechanics. Its not p2w but there are ads here and there it gives an high advatage but is not necessary. The reason i gave this amazing game a 4 stars is the bugs are too much but its fixable the bug that pisses me off the most is when it just freezes ur game while loading,4,2024-06-03 23:05:13

A Google user,It a great game. Not a multi-player. Levelling up to 21 is good. But then the pace slows down a lot. You eventually need to pay for hunters and better equipment to be able to progress at a good pace. So yeah another ptw game,2,2024-06-03 01:14:40

It really is annoying that you have to wait for almost 20 sec or more to get into the game just to encounter freezing issues and then when you restart it, you have to go through those loading screens again 😭.

Neutral - Ranking based game orientation heavily incentivises spending (This is normal, but the rankings aren't about being the Best Fighter.) A bit of story just glossed over.

A Google user,"Fun game, but the length and frequency of loading screens are insane. The game's already not the most snappy/optimized experience, but the unnecessary constant loading and server checks kills the flow. Especially egregious is the loading circle that triggers every time you enter the lobby from any menu. I basically avoid entering the lobby by menu hopping until I absolutely have to or am forced to.

Gold is used for everything, and you don't get enough to make any meaningful progression every day. The gear system is the most important part of progression, and with 5 stats, all dependant on RNG, you need luck on luck to get anything useful.

A Google user,I find the game and graphic astounding although too many glitches. Maybe just an idea. I think the game is too much on Jin Woo.

A Google user,Basically forcing you to do certain chapters whether you want to do them or not even if you would prefer to do one that would allow you to get higher ranks in previous ones. It should be just showing you what you can do but after I say let players play instead of just stating hey this is what you have to do next... this is what you have to do next.... this is what you have to do next.... this is what you have to do next... it's boring and annoying,1,2024-06-02 05:25:03

A Google user,This game is so advanced and fun and it's so easy to play but i have a couple problems because of the crowded battle area most of the time due to the team and opponents we need a better warning to dodge like something over the head like spidey sense or slowing down time to evade properly because most of the story you have to evade attacks and also when i kill an enemy it doesn't auto lock on to a next i have to do so repeatedly,5,2024-05-31 11:47:59

A Google user,"Looking at this from a game perspective, it's a fantastic mobile game. However like every mobile game, you are bombarded with a cash grab focus causing an unnecessary congestion for the UI. On top of that, literally everything you do is met with a server loading buffer like it needs to synch with the server after every action. These things alone make a great game a trash game.",2,2024-05-31 00:59:15

A Google user,overall game is gud but one gets stuck when when can't level up enough to beat certain levels. so one is left with nothing to do. there much be some system to be able to continuously progress without stop although it might result in faster completion of game. but that will also mean you (the creator of game) have to come up with new content often. a suggestion because game becomes repetitive after some point.,4,2024-05-31 00:32:04

A Google user,The game is great but the loading part takes forever and sometimes it's too laggy. I don't know if I'm the only one facing this issue,3,2024-05-30 09:12:56
A Google user,Its getting harder and boring. Its not about the skill issue its the massive power gap of bosses and poor drop artifacts. Most of the legendary artifacts sub stats are trashes. And again unreasonable power gap. Before you can take the boss you have to kill the elite monster which is pretty hard. Have to try another game. The hell is wrong with the freezing? I got a really good internet connection and j cant even proceed because of the loading icon. Very poor rating for me,1,2024-05-30 09:12:45
A Google user,it Nice 💯,5,2024-05-30 09:12:22
A Google user,"Very slow to play. Seems to need to load multiple times per screen, pop up, etc. Even on lowest settings and sounds off. Uninstalled, gave it a few weeks.

A Google user,"Came in on day one as a preregistration player. Graphics are amazing, follows the story very well. However, it's just not exciting anymore. Log in, do daily missions, gain a little power and play the story mode. Exit then repeat next day. The spawn rates for hunters or SSR weapons is very low. But what broke the game for me are the amount of popups from this latest update. Everytime I finish a mission, pop up, go to lobby, pop up. Maybe I will revisit if more exciting features are added.",1,2024-05-30 07:28:15

A Google user,Best solo leveling game right now and I love how there are real comic strips,5,2024-05-30 07:19:50
A Google user,Cool game and the systems in place to build up a interesting team are addicting. Has a drift effect on camera on pc and isn't optimized for keyboard and mouse. They throw ads in your face after practically every activity since the update on 5/28. Not to mention literally every single menu you navigate to and from has a loading sequence making just about every single part of the game a miserable waiting game regardless of the platform your playing on and hardware you are using. Would give 0 star,1,2024-05-30 07:16:51

However, we need more balancing in the amount of gold that players can get since the source of gold is quite scarce at this moment (with the current quickest way is by selling artifacts).

In addition, adding more source for weapons enhancement materials can be beneficial for players as well. Thank you!",5,2024-05-29 21:48:51

Microtransactions and loot boxes I would highly discourage getting due to the obscenely low rate (runes, weapons, etc).

The game-play is amazing, and so are the graphics!! If I had to say a negative thing about this game, it's the loading. When the game boots up and you're in the main menu, the game constantly loads whenever you interact with anything unless you're doing everything else outside the main menu. Highly recommend the game!",5,2024-05-29 13:35:44

A Google user,Enjoyable but frustrating. I like the game and playing casually I dont run out of things to do. The bad is I have had the game lock me out of controls during a mission for a second or two.

A Google user,"The game is surprisingly F2P Friendly (at least for now, we are talking about netmarble), although the game is pretty much new, looking forward for some buf fixes and optimisation right now, because the endless buffering through menu is annoying a lot. Other than that, the regular events and gameplay variety seems good for now. game would be top tier if we get to have shadow extraction directly through various contents, i would like to feel like i am a shadow monarch, and not some summoner.9/10",5,2024-05-29 12:42:39

A Google user,"""Solo Leveling: Arise"" delivers captivating gameplay and stunning graphics, immersing players in the solo leveling world. However, it lacks a feature to recycle hunters for gold, limiting strategic flexibility. With this addition, the game could reach even greater heights.",5,2024-05-29 12:07:27

A Google user,This is one of the best game from netmarble... This is best game related to anime... But in this game there is one thing wrong that is... We can't find more traces of shadows... They are very rare like when i played 4 to 5 gates one trace will be obtained... I think that's too much please see about this... Also sometimes game is hanging and it's not internet fault or anything.... Look after it... Otherwise this is the whole another world of game... ♥️,4,2024-05-29 12:04:35

A Google user,"Most other comments covered issues I agree with. Instead, I'll criticize any stage with the twisters that follow you. They're too fast, hit too hard, and last too long. Sometimes NEVER going away. They're perhaps the most imbalanced aspect of the game atm, misleading BP reqs for some encounters aside.",3,2024-05-29 11:14:00

A Google user,"I really like this franchise, and the game is entertaining. However, the constant buffering while navigating the various features definitely needs to be addressed. The lag is also felt during gameplay when attempting the 'extreme' dodges, or whatever they're called. Are there no servers in the USA? Or are they just very laggy? As it is, I may not bother to play much longer. I also keep getting notifications about receiving check-in or event rewards, but there's nothing available when I log in.",3,2024-05-29 11:07:35
A Google user,"This game is so amazing this game is based on the anime and the manga as well it has high quality graphics,and good storyline.The only problem is if your phone can't take this game(since it takes more than 3GB to download this will make your phone lag and sometimes froze)It's best to use this on PC, controller or xbox.developers need to fix Emma Laurent also because of its character therefore this is my top game of all time ☺️",5,2024-05-29 11:07:17

There no button whatsoever ever pls do something about it. But all gud",5,2024-05-29 10:58:57

A Google user,The App is Quite Good and fight are well made the bosses are Boss level But I think the loading Time is too much and starting the game to takes too much time and I would prefer if it could have a little more location and movability as the avatar hunter I created so I could actually say like*okay let me enter this dungeon and see the portal and see my self getting in* and I think 🤔 it would be better have a lot more skills and being able to attribute main character weapons to side characters use,3,2024-05-29 10:53:29

It gets challenging at times to get through a certain level but that's the part of the fun! the game has a lot to offer for free as well. you get to draw special items quite often and get SSR items very easily (or im just lucky lol?)

A Google user,Itwould be great if we can adjust the position of the movement pad for walking and running. And the size of it... but the game has the best setup. I like how the draws can be rarely generous... The characters are still somewhat recognizable from the manga I read. And I just hope the gold reward would be a little more generous in the equipment missions... And for the game to fit perfectly for my phone.. it has a lag and slow consistency in the graphics and can freeze occasionally on my phone...,5,2024-05-29 10:08:38

Switch account: because a many of the players have multiple accounts and its so inconvenient to log out first to enter into another account. 2.

Device optimization: a lot of mobile players still use low device.",4,2024-05-29 07:24:29

A Google user,"Has a faulty anti-cheat that detects something when nothing else is running. I would not recommend playing on PC until they fix this problem, as you could get banned for nothing, which is stupid. So, play on PC at your own risk. Also the leveling curve basically makes you completely stop playing the game other level logging in for the activity bonus which makes the game very boring and more annoying than fun.",1,2024-05-29 04:18:21

A Google user,"Good game, follows anime and manhwa fairly accurately. Game play is fun, challenging, and requires skill whether you are free to play or pay to win. Graphics and performance are excellent, but severely based on your device and its capabilities. The biggest issues are the loading times, lack of a real exp or gold farming, and level caps to progress the story/content. There are many games out there that are far worse and missed the mark, based off anime, manga or comics, this isn't one of them.",4,2024-05-29 03:12:19

Plse remove the cost when replacing the artifact, because it's useless. Players always collect new artifacts & replace them, it's better for you to give us upgrade materials from unused (sold) artifacts. Plse fix it, thx.",3,2024-05-28 20:55:06

Only reason for the 4 star review is because of the constant loading circles going from menu to menu. Sometimes it lasts a few seconds, others it's lasted over a minute. Very annoying to deal with when you have limited time to play. Other than that I see no real flaws with the game so far. 2 weeks into the game upon writing this review.",4,2024-05-28 20:10:17

I would love to try again after sometime if they do away with loading times after every click of a button.",3,2024-05-28 20:08:37

A Google user,"Weird loading areas at pretty much every screen change, and the game constantly locks / freezes up in the middle of battle. Don't know why... my phone is not even working hard. I can not figure out how some people are giving the game 5 stars when they have valid complaints about the game. 5 stars means it is perfect. I did have this as a 3-star review, but I am adjusting to 2 stars to balance them out. The game does work better on my Legion Go, but this is a mobile phone review.",2,2024-05-28 19:36:34
